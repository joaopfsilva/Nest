Nest Landing Page - NLP 
=====

NLP (No, it's not related with Natural language processing :) ) is an under construction landing page for a private project that is being developed by the contributors of this repository. The landing page intends to present the functionalities and potential of the platform Nest.

This new platform will create a new way of interaction between people-places and people-people, allowing to people understand 'what is' and 'who is' around them.

The project was built in Rails 5 and hosted in Heroku.


Work in progress.
